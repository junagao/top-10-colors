# Top 10 colors

This is a colors rating app implemented with a rating system which lets the user rate the colors manually or randomly.

Random rating will happen when you click the random rate button which will pick a color randomly, rate it with a value between 1 and 5 stars and after a random time defined between 500 and 1000ms it will proceed to rate another color. The rating will go on until the user click the stop rating button.
